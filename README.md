## Method
Below are provided the steps that were followed for this project. Each step and classifiers have their own document.

1. **Data visualisation & Preprocessing**: with the knowledge acquired with the preceding step, apply preprocessing of data including dealing with missing values, drop unuseful features and build new features
2. **Regression**: use regression techniques based on the preprocessed data using a variety of algorithms



## Folder structures
* `\` contains all of the jupyter's notebooks including classifiers, preprocessing and data visualization
* `\Data` contains the project dataset given in the Kaggle challenge
* `\Data\outputs` contains the outputs given by the classifiers that were submitted to Kaggle

## Installation instructions
1. Install Python and clone this repository
2. Install required Python modules with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

to run the [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)'s notebooks just go with `jupyter notebook`
